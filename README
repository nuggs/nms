Latest merc release without mob progs and updated networking to take advantage of IPv6.

Todo is to add scripting for mobs, objects, rooms, areas and globally.  Also I would like
to convert area files to json and then also add database support(PostgreSQL/MariaDB).
I'd prefer to also separate objects and npcs from area files and have them be separate.
We'll see...

Other than that, have fun, no requirements from me other than following the original license
agreement from the previous developers.  They did all the work, I'm just playing around.
